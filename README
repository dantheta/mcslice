MCSlice - Minecraft Map Slice Viewer
Daniel Ramsay <daniel@dretzq.org.uk>

Shows a 2-dimensional cross-section view of a minecraft map, with color
highlighting of desirable ores.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

python 2.6+
simplejson
pygame

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

Run:

$ python mcdump.py ~/.minecraft/saves/<savegame>/regions/*.mcr

This creates unpacked region chunks in a "dump" directory.

Then, run: 

$ python explore.py [x position] [z position]

to run the cross-section viewer.  X & Z parameters are optional.

CONTROLS
--------

Up/Down			move +/- along Z axis
Left/Right		move +/- along X axis (jump by 16 blocks)
PgUp/PgDown		move +/- 10 on Z axis
Equals/Minus	zoom in/out

Left-click		show co-ordinates and material for block under cursor

BUGS
----

* Display lurches when moving through the z-layer to a new row of chunks
* Not a complete NBT parser.  Cheats horribly.
* Inefficient storage of chunk data
* Pretty poor handling of clicks outside the map
* No vertical panning
* No sky color!
* Many more!
